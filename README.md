Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by splitting the dataset into subsets based on the value of input features, effectively creating a tree-like structure where each node represents a decision based on a specific feature. The branches represent the outcome of that decision, and the leaves of the tree indicate the predicted class or value.

One of the main advantages of decision trees is their interpretability; they can be easily visualized and understood, allowing users to follow the decision-making process. They handle both numerical and categorical data and do not require extensive data preprocessing. However, decision trees are prone to overfitting, especially when they become too deep, which can affect their performance on unseen data. Techniques such as pruning, using ensemble methods like random forests, or setting constraints on tree depth can help mitigate this issue.
